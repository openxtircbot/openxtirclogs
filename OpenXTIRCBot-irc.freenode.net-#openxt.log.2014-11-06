2014-11-06 08:51:24,391 - #openxt	aikidoka	dammit, we are being recorded!
2014-11-06 08:51:48,877 - #openxt	bennettj	well, maybe. haha. phenny does not come with a logging module so I grabbed some random one off the internet. I'm not certain it is doing anything yet.
2014-11-06 08:51:57,897 - #openxt	aikidoka	Was seeing if anybody was around about the scripts but I just found them.
2014-11-06 08:52:28,638 - #openxt	bennettj	i take that back. we are for sure being recorded. haha.
2014-11-06 08:52:37,208 - #openxt	aikidoka	But it looks like it just reads in the keyboard map in an ash script so not really sure why it thinks there is a parse error.
2014-11-06 08:52:41,077 - #openxt	bennettj	now to figure out how often this thing rotates log files.
2014-11-06 08:53:00,901 - #openxt	bennettj	yeah, i have never seen a problem at that step of the installer before. seems pretty strange.
2014-11-06 08:53:13,637 - #openxt	aikidoka	The actual scripts are all the same size.
2014-11-06 08:54:03,720 - #openxt	aikidoka	hmmm, both are busybox 1.13.2 but I have r26 and not r24.
2014-11-06 08:54:17,546 - #openxt	aikidoka	I doubt there is a patch doing it.
2014-11-06 08:54:42,249 - #openxt	aikidoka	so close!

2014-11-06 11:15:10 - #openxt	jed_home	build successful \o/

2014-11-06 11:17:21 - #openxt	aikidoka	So loadkeys is failing to load the keymap in my installer
2014-11-06 11:17:32 - #openxt	aikidoka	trying to find a way to test it outside of the installer, unsuccessfully.
2014-11-06 11:49:04 - #openxt	chrisp__1	rphilipson: what did your debug environment look like when debugging tboot issues?
2014-11-06 11:52:47 - #openxt	rphilipson	mostly serial output
2014-11-06 11:53:10 - #openxt	rphilipson	one of the patches adds express card serial support but it is incomplete
2014-11-06 11:53:31 - #openxt	rphilipson	sometimes i had to hack up grub when i needed pre-tboot information
2014-11-06 11:54:14 - #openxt	rphilipson	as far as what happens in the ACMs, that is tough though i was able to disasm them and figure bits out here and there
2014-11-06 11:54:47 - #openxt	jed_home	btw chrisp__1, my build of your stuff installed and ran fine, let me know if you want more testing
2014-11-06 11:55:06 - #openxt	chrisp__1	thanks! i think i need merging now :)
2014-11-06 11:55:20 - #openxt	chrisp__1	that will make life much easier

2014-11-06 12:02:10 - #openxt	chrisp__1	nicely done, you gonna update the ticket? :) thanks
2014-11-06 12:02:12 - #openxt	jed_home	now, what's the best way to tell people that they need to change their build tree and .config to continue building OpenXT? :p
2014-11-06 12:02:35 - #openxt	jed_home	heading to the ticket now
2014-11-06 12:02:37 - #openxt	chrisp__1	that's what i was just wondering
2014-11-06 12:02:40 - #openxt	chrisp__1	i copied that info into the ticket
2014-11-06 12:02:52 - #openxt	chrisp__1	i think IRC is probably the best bet!
2014-11-06 12:03:25 - #openxt	jed_home	I don't seem to be allowed to do anything to the ticket...
2014-11-06 12:03:32 - #openxt	chrisp__1	so for anyone that's going to be updating their xenclient-oe anytime soon
2014-11-06 12:03:35 - #openxt	chrisp__1	OPENXT_GIT_MIRROR needs to be re-defined to github.com/OpenXT instead of git://github.com/OpenXT
2014-11-06 12:03:38 - #openxt	chrisp__1	OPENXT_GIT_PROTOCOL needs to be defined as "git"|"https"
2014-11-06 12:03:38 - #openxt	chrisp__1	You can make the mods in your local.conf as well as want to edit your .config for future use.
2014-11-06 12:03:42 - #openxt	chrisp__1	OPENXT_BRANCH needs to be defined as "master"
2014-11-06 12:03:47 - #openxt	chrisp__1	jed_home: i'll check your groups
2014-11-06 12:05:26 - #openxt	chrisp__1	check now?
2014-11-06 12:06:09 - #openxt	jed_home	a button saying "Done" popped up, so I clicked on it, looks happy :)
2014-11-06 12:06:40 - #openxt	jed_home	did you fix the example config file?
2014-11-06 12:14:00 - #openxt	chrisp__1	yeah

2014-11-06 12:16:28 - #openxt	chrisp__1	yes, thanks for that!
2014-11-06 12:16:37 - #openxt	chrisp__1	you can test oxt-20 if you are feeling brave now
2014-11-06 12:16:40 - #openxt	chrisp__1	that's an easy one
2014-11-06 12:17:52 - #openxt	jed_home	ok I'll have a look
2014-11-06 12:18:13 - #openxt	jed_home	I'm buying a house at the same time, so (slow) testing is pretty much all I can do ^^
2014-11-06 12:20:39 - #openxt	jed_home	chrisp__1, [oxt-20] the whole pq applies without any complaint?!
2014-11-06 12:21:40 - #openxt	rphilipson	guilt tends to hide warning and fuzzies doesnt it?
2014-11-06 12:22:11 - #openxt	jed_home	does, as long as everything applies somehow :)
2014-11-06 12:22:29 - #openxt	rphilipson	somehow :)
2014-11-06 12:34:37 - #openxt	jed_home	chrisp__1, could you rebase oxt-20-v2?
2014-11-06 12:53:29 - #openxt	chrisp__1	sure
2014-11-06 12:54:28 - #openxt	chrisp__1	but it's still mergeable, does it really need to be rebased?
2014-11-06 12:55:33 - #openxt	chrisp__1	the end result should be the same, unless i'm missing something
2014-11-06 13:28:43 - #openxt	jed_home	chrisp__1, the idea was just to build with cjp256/openxt:oxt-20-v2 in place of openxt/openxt:master to test a whole build
2014-11-06 13:39:37 - #openxt	chrisp__1	oh ok
2014-11-06 13:39:53 - #openxt	chrisp__1	give me a few minutes
2014-11-06 13:57:35 - #openxt	chrisp__1	jed_home: you gonna test from a clean slate?
2014-11-06 13:58:04 - #openxt	chrisp__1	if not, you just need to update your local.conf with the bits in the common-config
2014-11-06 13:58:52 - #openxt	jed_home	yeah from scratch
2014-11-06 14:00:04 - #openxt	chrisp__1	https://github.com/OpenXT/openxt/pull/39

2014-11-06 15:31:30 - #openxt	jed_home	it was pretty recent
2014-11-06 15:31:39 - #openxt	chrisp__1	really wasnt too bad actually
2014-11-06 15:31:56 - #openxt	chrisp__1	there were just patches that apparently had been applied w/o cve references
2014-11-06 15:32:01 - #openxt	chrisp__1	thank you OE dylan
2014-11-06 15:37:55 - #openxt	aikidoka	dizzy (1.7) is out now.
2014-11-06 15:39:51 - #openxt	chrisp__1	yeah, but they updated to bash 4.3
2014-11-06 15:40:02 - #openxt	chrisp__1	dylan is still maintained with bash 4.2 :)
2014-11-06 15:43:27 - #openxt	aikidoka	is 4.3 an issue?
2014-11-06 15:43:46 - #openxt	rphilipson	jed_home: yea i think the funky wire connection to the enclosure got busted
2014-11-06 15:43:47 - #openxt	aikidoka	daisy is 4.3 also.
2014-11-06 15:44:02 - #openxt	chrisp__1	we are using 4.2
2014-11-06 15:45:02 - #openxt	chrisp__1	we'll uprev when you do ;)
2014-11-06 15:51:01 - #openxt	aikidoka	just wondering if there were known issues as mine is building with bash 4.3 right now
2014-11-06 15:53:05 - #openxt	aikidoka	hmmm, my console-tools version matches what we had before.  Wonder why loadkeys claims there is parse error
2014-11-06 15:58:57 - #openxt	chrisp__1	i doubt there would be issues with 4.3, I just didn't want to uprev it for no reason (4.3 would need the patches too anyways)
2014-11-06 16:05:40 - #openxt	aikidoka	hmmm, I could have lost loadkeys's ability to deal with gz files
2014-11-06 16:08:36 - #openxt	chrisp__1	oh AUTOREV... here I am just doing my build, minding my own business, and all of a sudden, i gotta recompile all my kernels. :)
2014-11-06 16:18:06 - #openxt	aikidoka	ha ha
2014-11-06 16:18:06 - #openxt	aikidoka	got get some coffee.

2014-11-06 16:18:25 - #openxt	aikidoka	I have to recompile console-tools
2014-11-06 17:05:36 - #openxt	chrisp__1	well unless the incremental build went foobar, this openxt install is not happy with the fixed bash. gonna be a long coffee break for a fresh build...
2014-11-06 17:08:26 - #openxt	aikidoka	yeah, my console-tools stuff didn't fix loadkeys either
2014-11-06 17:18:21 - #openxt	chrisp__1	:(
2014-11-06 18:46:38 - #openxt	aikidoka	Need to compare compiler options I guess.  Or copy the binary out of the working version to see if that makes it work.
2014-11-06 21:04:55 - #openxt	chrisp__1	aikidoka: yeah 4.3 is vuln but daisy&dizzy has the patches applied - are your bits based on daisy or dizzy?
2014-11-06 21:11:35 - #openxt	aikidoka	daisy
2014-11-06 21:11:54 - #openxt	aikidoka	But at the moment more concerned with it actually working!!!
2014-11-06 21:11:56 - #openxt	aikidoka	:-/
2014-11-06 21:12:07 - #openxt	aikidoka	going to copy the original loadkeys
2014-11-06 22:59:43 - #openxt	aikidoka	success!
2014-11-06 22:59:52 - #openxt	aikidoka	Had to ditch console-tools for kbd
2014-11-06 23:00:26 - #openxt	aikidoka	now I need to finish the initscripts work before even bothering with installs.
