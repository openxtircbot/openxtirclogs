2014-11-07 02:47:12 - #openxt	zhalas	hi
2014-11-07 07:06:10 - #openxt	aikidoka	zhalas: morning
2014-11-07 07:22:45 - #openxt	kevin_home	aikidoka: messages at 23:18 and 07:24...do you sleep?
2014-11-07 07:27:03 - #openxt	aikidoka	but that's only 23:18
2014-11-07 07:28:41 - #openxt	aikidoka	If I was hourly I'd be done working by Wednesday nights!
2014-11-07 09:05:53 - #openxt	rphilipson	chrisp__1, are you about?
2014-11-07 09:23:28 - #openxt	chrisp__1	yep
2014-11-07 09:25:04 - #openxt	chrisp__1	good mornin
2014-11-07 09:29:27 - #openxt	rphilipson	mornin to you toos
2014-11-07 09:30:22 - #openxt	rphilipson	so the usb panic that this is a workaround for: https://github.com/OpenXT/linux-3.11-pq/pull/3
2014-11-07 09:30:34 - #openxt	rphilipson	i cannot repro it - any suggestions?
2014-11-07 09:30:53 - #openxt	rphilipson	sounds like AIS QA saw it often
2014-11-07 09:39:38 - #openxt	chrisp__1	i think the main test cases I heard were: repeatedly plugging/unplugging a device, and copying from from USB HD to another. but i'll ask the test team for more infos (and update the ticket)
2014-11-07 09:51:28 - #openxt	rphilipson	ok thx
2014-11-07 09:51:40 - #openxt	rphilipson	i can try some of those - i am actually doing the plug/unplug
2014-11-07 09:52:02 - #openxt	rphilipson	and i am seeing the orphaned xenstore nodes and dead HCDs in the Windows guests
2014-11-07 09:52:18 - #openxt	chrisp__1	did you look at https://openxt.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/10100/USB%20Testing.docx ?
2014-11-07 09:53:07 - #openxt	chrisp__1	(under oxt-12)
2014-11-07 09:54:23 - #openxt	rphilipson	no i overlooked that
2014-11-07 09:59:50 - #openxt	chrisp__1	k
2014-11-07 10:00:01 - #openxt	rphilipson	will check it out, thx
2014-11-07 10:00:58 - #openxt	chrisp__1	oxt-7 could use some review/merge love for anyone who has the time
2014-11-07 10:02:57 - #openxt	chrisp__1	what i've been doing is setting my tickets to 'Review' status to indicate that they are ready for test/review/merge.  that sound about right?  
2014-11-07 10:04:50 - #openxt	rphilipson	hmm i closed mine out of habit i guess but that sounds more correct - though i am not sure exactly who will review it
2014-11-07 10:18:43 - #openxt	kevin_home	On that, do we want to encourage the use of JIRA command directives in git commit messages (in addition to the JIRA ticket number)?
2014-11-07 10:19:19 - #openxt	kevin_home	https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AOD/Processing+JIRA+issues+with+commit+messages
2014-11-07 10:19:49 - #openxt	kevin_home	That would allow the person doing the actual merge to #close tickets all in one go
2014-11-07 10:21:01 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	rphilipson: I was able to replicate by starting a Win 7 guest
2014-11-07 10:21:13 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	inserting a USB DVD drive and USB drive
2014-11-07 10:21:24 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	and copying ~1GB from DVD to flash drive
2014-11-07 10:22:29 - #openxt	rphilipson	ok thanks - i will try that
2014-11-07 10:23:00 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	usually took no more than 1-2mins of doing that
2014-11-07 10:23:24 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	but masterb was unable to replicate, I think it's due to an iffy HCD driver?
2014-11-07 10:23:32 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	seems like only saw it on some types of machines
2014-11-07 10:23:42 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	(I can confirm it borking on Dell 9010)
2014-11-07 10:26:58 - #openxt	rphilipson	trying on my 6430
2014-11-07 10:27:25 - #openxt	rphilipson	2G in flight...
2014-11-07 10:27:40 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	oh
2014-11-07 10:27:49 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	I read that as you were using 2G data while flying
2014-11-07 10:27:58 - #openxt	rphilipson	:)
2014-11-07 10:28:24 - #openxt	rphilipson	DVD -> 2G -> Flash drive
2014-11-07 10:31:14 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	ok
2014-11-07 10:31:21 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	hi masterb :)
2014-11-07 10:31:26 - #openxt	masterb	hello
2014-11-07 10:31:44 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	comment ca va?
2014-11-07 10:32:00 - #openxt	masterb	ca va, tranquille, et toi?
2014-11-07 10:32:24 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	bien, c'est vendredi
2014-11-07 10:32:32 - #openxt	masterb	:)
2014-11-07 10:32:56 - #openxt	masterb	I was wondering if I should have said "et vous?", and I have no idea ^^
2014-11-07 10:33:11 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	et je suis une fete ce soir
2014-11-07 10:33:29 - #openxt	masterb	:)
2014-11-07 10:33:29 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	ACTION c'est un garcon
2014-11-07 10:33:45 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	tu est propre
2014-11-07 10:33:57 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	et nous sommes amis
2014-11-07 10:34:23 - #openxt	masterb	oui mais on dit "vous" pour marquer le respect!
2014-11-07 10:34:59 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	no dit "tu" avec amis?
2014-11-07 10:35:24 - #openxt	masterb	http://www.lactualite.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/%C2%A9LATimes-Tu-Vous.png
2014-11-07 10:36:16 - #openxt	masterb	yeah, true, you're not a co-worker yet :p
2014-11-07 10:36:50 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	but even so
2014-11-07 10:36:54 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	we are like "le Google"
2014-11-07 10:37:02 - #openxt	masterb	yeah, just saw that box ^^
2014-11-07 10:38:42 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	man, flying on Delta out of a United hub looks terrible
2014-11-07 10:39:41 - #openxt	kevin_home	Anyone tinker with xenpm in OpenXT (or XCXT even) yet?
2014-11-07 10:39:59 - #openxt	rphilipson	no repro :(
2014-11-07 10:47:48 - #openxt	kevin_home	Appears pretty nifty. Good for getting some statistics at least
2014-11-07 10:49:03 - #openxt	kevin_home	Maybe I'll play with the tweaks over the weekend
2014-11-07 11:28:34 - #openxt	chrisp__1	kevin_home: would you use the #close on the pull request merge commit message (in github?)
2014-11-07 11:29:16 - #openxt	chrisp__1	what about commits that have multiple pull requests to complete it?
2014-11-07 11:30:06 - #openxt	chrisp__1	masterb: good call with the topic there
2014-11-07 11:31:34 - #openxt	masterb	tx
2014-11-07 11:34:18 - #openxt	kevin_home	chrisp__1: Actually, I think #close would probably be best on the merge commit on the last push. Probably would recommend using #comment on merge commits on related so that they also push commits in JIRA
2014-11-07 11:34:37 - #openxt	kevin_home	One of the problems that comes from multi-repo projects
2014-11-07 11:35:19 - #openxt	kevin_home	But ideally it would either be one person doing the merge/push or at least a coordinated effort, so a series of #comment terminated with a final #close on the last push should suffice
2014-11-07 11:51:42 - #openxt	chrisp__1	fair enough
2014-11-07 11:52:52 - #openxt	chrisp__1	i'll try it out on my next merge and see if it works
2014-11-07 14:52:01 - #openxt	chrisp__1	anyone else here able to do incremental rebuilds without it going to hell? i'm just not having luck lately.
2014-11-07 14:53:20 - #openxt	masterb	my last successful one was 4 years ago :)
2014-11-07 14:54:32 - #openxt	chrisp__1	lucky you!
2014-11-07 14:56:28 - #openxt	rphilipson	rogersc: it looks like you fixed your jira issue?
2014-11-07 14:57:14 - #openxt	chrisp__1	i added him to jira-developers
