2014-11-13 08:39:36 - #openxt	qdickon	out of interest is anyone looking at running Intel GVT-g (formerly XenGT) on OpenXT yet? Specifically the trust model may be a problem but i understand it is working fairly well these days.
2014-11-13 08:46:57 - #openxt	qdickon	ugh lost my nick agai
2014-11-13 08:47:01 - #openxt	dickonr	better
2014-11-13 09:28:11 - #openxt	rphilipson	dickonr: no, i dont think anybody is looking at GVT yet
2014-11-13 09:28:40 - #openxt	rphilipson	though it should be on the overall wish list
2014-11-13 09:40:13 - #openxt	chrisp__1	i had it running in a standalone OE xen image: https://github.com/cjp256/hype-scripts . out of date, but nothing for XT tho.
2014-11-13 10:04:08 - #openxt	rphilipson	maybe we should have periodic triages of pull requests so we don't start building up large backlogs of them
2014-11-13 10:04:12 - #openxt	rphilipson	e.g. refpolicy-mcs: fix path for file_contexts to point to image 
2014-11-13 10:04:22 - #openxt	rphilipson	has been stuck in the queue for a while
2014-11-13 10:48:31 - #openxt	chrisp__1	ya, that one should be rebased
2014-11-13 10:49:17 - #openxt	chrisp__1	but I have been wondering about how to encourage people to do review/merge of tickets in 'Review' status
2014-11-13 10:51:59 - #openxt	chrisp__1	then close the ticket after merge or use the #closes thing pearson suggested
2014-11-13 12:10:05 - #openxt	earl	ls
2014-11-13 12:11:45 - #openxt	chrisp__1	hey jed, did you get around to testing oxt-20 (xen 4.3.3?) i think you said you were giving it a spin
2014-11-13 12:22:19 - #openxt	masterb	I have it built and installed on my test machine
2014-11-13 12:22:31 - #openxt	masterb	but I can do much with it, as my test machine is half borked
2014-11-13 12:24:07 - #openxt	chrisp__1	thanks.  my next aim is to clear out the XSA backfill (oxt9), so I was just waiting on the 4.3.3 to hit master
2014-11-13 12:24:18 - #openxt	chrisp__1	anyone else care to take 4.3.3 for a test spin? :)
2014-11-13 12:30:21 - #openxt	rphilipson	my limited test kit is all rigged up for usb testing and dev, sorry
2014-11-13 12:33:23 - #openxt	masterb	chrisp__1, I'm trying to get a VM running on my laptop, hopefully win7 doesn't mind too much about random Alt and 9 keypresses :)
2014-11-13 12:33:43 - #openxt	masterb	if the tools install and run, I think it'll be enough to merge
2014-11-13 12:37:22 - #openxt	masterb	I assume the heavy screen flashing is caused by my laptop and doesn't happen during your tests chrisp__1 :p
2014-11-13 12:43:12 - #openxt	brendan__	masterb: I was talking to Rian yesterday and he said you had some reservations about sourcing input directly as HID in dom0. Any particular reasons?
2014-11-13 12:43:37 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	why doesn't Rian join here?
2014-11-13 12:45:09 - #openxt	masterb	brendan__, yup, the reason is that HID events are in the format defined in the HID descriptor, which means that to parse them we need to parse the HID desc to figure out the syntax
2014-11-13 12:45:43 - #openxt	masterb	then we probably want to convert them to a common format so that we can process them
2014-11-13 12:46:12 - #openxt	masterb	all of that is exactly what Linux does with /dev/input/enventX...
2014-11-13 12:46:41 - #openxt	rphilipson	it is easier to form HID events than to parse them
2014-11-13 12:47:11 - #openxt	masterb	yeah, that's a good way to put it :)
2014-11-13 12:54:55 - #openxt	brendan__	sirnarwhal: Because Apple hasn't released an official IRC client ;) 
2014-11-13 12:55:56 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	lol
2014-11-13 12:55:58 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	tool
2014-11-13 13:10:25 - #openxt	chrisp__1	there is "Textual" in the app store!
2014-11-13 13:10:36 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	well
2014-11-13 13:10:45 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	considering how bad he is about responding to emails
2014-11-13 13:10:51 - #openxt	sirnarwhal	I bet his IRC would be even worse
2014-11-13 13:12:56 - #openxt	chrisp__1	hah
2014-11-13 13:17:19 - #openxt	rphilipson	nice 4.3.3 is in \o/
2014-11-13 13:38:23 - #openxt	chrisp__1	thanks jed!
2014-11-13 13:38:27 - #openxt	chrisp__1	testing the XSAs now
2014-11-13 13:38:44 - #openxt	rphilipson	didn't 4.3.3 pull in a bunch of XSA's?
2014-11-13 13:38:52 - #openxt	rphilipson	how many more need to go in?
2014-11-13 13:41:34 - #openxt	chrisp__1	4 
2014-11-13 13:41:38 - #openxt	chrisp__1	104,105,106,108
2014-11-13 13:42:12 - #openxt	rphilipson	not too bad
2014-11-13 13:42:25 - #openxt	rphilipson	i put test instruction in the one for 108 but it is really untestable
2014-11-13 13:42:32 - #openxt	rphilipson	since our vms never enable x2apic
2014-11-13 13:42:34 - #openxt	chrisp__1	and there was an update to xsa-59
2014-11-13 13:42:35 - #openxt	chrisp__1	http://xenbits.xen.org/gitweb/?p=xen.git;a=commit;h=3e2331d271cc0882e4013c8f20398c46c35f90a1
2014-11-13 13:42:52 - #openxt	chrisp__1	eh, I just validated that the patches applied in the working tree
2014-11-13 13:43:06 - #openxt	chrisp__1	and if it boots, happy thoughts
2014-11-13 14:12:09 - #openxt	rphilipson	this is a pretty major fix to pv usb: https://github.com/OpenXT/xc-windows/pull/12
2014-11-13 14:12:31 - #openxt	rphilipson	without this you can't really plug and unplug anything in a vm
2014-11-13 14:12:45 - #openxt	rphilipson	and vms hang up or cannot shutdown
2014-11-13 14:14:19 - #openxt	rphilipson	anybody out there that can review a windows kernel fix to xenbus?
2014-11-13 14:16:43 - #openxt	earl	are you looking for just a code review or full blown testing... i have some cycles to spare if you want me to review... not that i really have any experience with OpenXt
2014-11-13 14:24:11 - #openxt	rphilipson	that would be great - i put a lot of details in the commit message and the ticket about what is going on
2014-11-13 14:24:16 - #openxt	rphilipson	and what the fix is trying to do
2014-11-13 14:24:23 - #openxt	rphilipson	https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-35
2014-11-13 14:24:52 - #openxt	rphilipson	bear in mind though, the current XT xenbus driver is a mess
2014-11-13 14:25:23 - #openxt	earl	lol yeah i was thinking that i do like all of your comments though I should be more verbose with mine
2014-11-13 14:25:23 - #openxt	rphilipson	that is why i tried to isolate all the changes to only vusb devices and left everything else alon
2014-11-13 14:25:24 - #openxt	rphilipson	e
2014-11-13 14:34:55 - #openxt	earl	so code wise I don't see an y problems...
2014-11-13 14:37:13 - #openxt	rphilipson	ok
2014-11-13 14:37:27 - #openxt	rphilipson	the code to cleanup after DeviceClassReconnectNotSupported returns TRUE
2014-11-13 14:37:52 - #openxt	rphilipson	i took from an error block just below so it should be cleaning everything up correctly
2014-11-13 14:39:10 - #openxt	earl	yeah i like the added function... it cleanups up that really long function...
2014-11-13 14:40:08 - #openxt	rphilipson	yea that probe function is a horror
2014-11-13 14:40:59 - #openxt	rphilipson	there are piles of code to make device reconnect work too from previous days
2014-11-13 14:41:20 - #openxt	rphilipson	it makes me O_o everytime i look at it
2014-11-13 14:42:54 - #openxt	rphilipson	thanks for looking at it
2014-11-13 14:43:13 - #openxt	earl	yeah... it hear that... because the logic flow wasn't done logical way the 1st time everyone just patches it
2014-11-13 14:43:41 - #openxt	earl	I don't mind doing the code review i need to learn more
2014-11-13 14:49:07 - #openxt	rphilipson	the ultimate plan is to move to the oss xenserver windows drivers
2014-11-13 14:49:16 - #openxt	rphilipson	but i dont see that happening very soon
2014-11-13 14:50:13 - #openxt	earl	yeah...  i feel like you guys are moving fairly quickly but seems like there is alot of upstreaming going on
2014-11-13 14:55:30 - #openxt	Lingo_	yo
2014-11-13 14:55:32 - #openxt	rphilipson	there is plenty to do, that is for sure
2014-11-13 14:57:02 - #openxt	rianquinn	test
2014-11-13 14:57:10 - #openxt	rphilipson	rianquinn nice of you to show up :)
2014-11-13 14:57:31 - #openxt	masterb	\o/
2014-11-13 14:57:55 - #openxt	rianquinn	yeah, chris reminded me I was missing all of the fun :)
2014-11-13 14:58:09 - #openxt	rphilipson	plus we have been talking about you
2014-11-13 14:58:23 - #openxt	rianquinn	All good things I'm sure !!!
2014-11-13 14:58:31 - #openxt	rianquinn	:)
2014-11-13 14:58:40 - #openxt	rphilipson	oh yea, all good :)
2014-11-13 15:09:50 - #openxt	brendan__	lol
2014-11-13 15:10:12 - #openxt	chrisp__1	quinn told me that he already owned Textual
2014-11-13 15:10:29 - #openxt	chrisp__1	was there any resolution on how we get updates to the official mirror?
2014-11-13 15:11:14 - #openxt	chrisp__1	i forget which ticket brought that up
2014-11-13 15:11:33 - #openxt	rphilipson	well we discussed moving the mirror into a repo
2014-11-13 15:11:48 - #openxt	rphilipson	but there were the 2 giant monsters in there that prevented that
2014-11-13 15:12:57 - #openxt	rphilipson	https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/openxt/9ZSfH5IW5Lw
2014-11-13 15:14:28 - #openxt	chrisp__1	Need some method to update the official mirror.
2014-11-13 15:14:28 - #openxt	chrisp__1	My thought is to simply create a github git repo and use their raw content functionality, e.g.:
2014-11-13 15:14:32 - #openxt	chrisp__1	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenXT/openxt/master/README.md
2014-11-13 15:15:10 - #openxt	chrisp__1	why can't debootstrap and linux be committed?
2014-11-13 15:15:16 - #openxt	chrisp__1	are there size constraints on the git repo?
2014-11-13 15:15:36 - #openxt	rphilipson	i don't know if there are size constraints 
2014-11-13 15:15:37 - #openxt	chrisp__1	(other than .git being potentially huge in the future)
2014-11-13 15:15:42 - #openxt	masterb	git is just not a fan of big files, neither is github...
2014-11-13 15:16:05 - #openxt	rphilipson	and once that rubbish is in the history, the repo will be huge for all time
2014-11-13 15:16:15 - #openxt	chrisp__1	yeah, but could always reinit
2014-11-13 15:16:46 - #openxt	earl	as long as its in a seperate repo... the only major downside for git.. is searches...
2014-11-13 15:18:02 - #openxt	rphilipson	yea we can reinit - sort of defeats having a repo
2014-11-13 15:18:11 - #openxt	chrisp__1	it's just free hosting :)
2014-11-13 15:18:28 - #openxt	masterb	works for me
2014-11-13 15:18:31 - #openxt	chrisp__1	at some point once you remove the huge blobs, it shouldn't be all that bad
2014-11-13 15:18:33 - #openxt	rphilipson	fine
2014-11-13 15:18:48 - #openxt	masterb	if the commit even goes through :)
2014-11-13 15:19:20 - #openxt	rphilipson	yea, try pushing huge piles of binaries to a personal repo first chrisp__1
2014-11-13 15:19:29 - #openxt	chrisp__1	yeah i'll give it a shot
2014-11-13 15:19:45 - #openxt	chrisp__1	i just have another file to add the mirror
2014-11-13 15:19:47 - #openxt	masterb	that's gonna be a cool pull request :)
2014-11-13 15:19:53 - #openxt	chrisp__1	seems silly to ask phil to add each file
2014-11-13 15:20:01 - #openxt	masterb	yes
2014-11-13 15:20:02 - #openxt	rphilipson	indeed
2014-11-13 15:22:21 - #openxt	rphilipson	so i count 1 request by chrisp__1 and two +1's
2014-11-13 15:22:25 - #openxt	rphilipson	do we need more?
2014-11-13 15:22:41 - #openxt	rphilipson	come on folks, lets get some +1's !!
2014-11-13 15:23:26 - #openxt	earl	+1
2014-11-13 15:25:03 - #openxt	rphilipson	chrisp__1 do you want me to create an empty repo for you to fork and load up?
2014-11-13 15:29:09 - #openxt	brendan__	+1
2014-11-13 15:30:33 - #openxt	chrisp__1	yeah do it up
2014-11-13 15:34:28 - #openxt	chrisp__1	could perhaps just fix the debootstrap first
2014-11-13 15:35:51 - #openxt	chrisp__1	to make the debootstrap packages, does anyone know if any additional packages were generated?
2014-11-13 15:46:12 - #openxt	rossp	chrisp__1: sorry my home network is borked
2014-11-13 15:46:22 - #openxt	rossp	i got blown off on my main dev machine
2014-11-13 15:46:39 - #openxt	rossp	do you want a repo called "mirror"?
2014-11-13 15:50:22 - #openxt	rphilipson	ok back
2014-11-13 15:51:01 - #openxt	chrisp__1	i'll just make it, if it works out, then i'll have you make it
2014-11-13 15:51:09 - #openxt	chrisp__1	if it doesn't work, not much of a point i guess :)
2014-11-13 15:51:28 - #openxt	rphilipson	ok
2014-11-13 15:51:32 - #openxt	rphilipson	i bet it will work
2014-11-13 15:52:14 - #openxt	rphilipson	https://github.com/blog/1533-new-file-size-limits
2014-11-13 15:52:30 - #openxt	rickl	from what jed told me a while back, there aren't any custom packages in the debootstrap image
2014-11-13 15:53:23 - #openxt	rphilipson	rickl: yea i think the only sticking point is if you generate it, you have checksum issues with the recipe
2014-11-13 15:55:15 - #openxt	rphilipson	remote: warning: Large files detected.
2014-11-13 15:55:15 - #openxt	rphilipson	# remote: error: File giant_file is 123.00 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100 MB
2014-11-13 15:55:52 - #openxt	rickl	good point - I think that's the main reason I didn't remove the image before we put the code on github
2014-11-13 15:56:10 - #openxt	rphilipson	i think so too
2014-11-13 15:56:18 - #openxt	rphilipson	in fact i think you told me that was the issue :)
2014-11-13 15:57:45 - #openxt	rphilipson	anyway i think this is going to fail - i think the file size limit is 100M
2014-11-13 16:00:04 - #openxt	chrisp__1	ya
2014-11-13 16:00:34 - #openxt	rphilipson	maybe you can chunk those files up and write a recipe to put them back together :)
2014-11-13 16:19:59 - #openxt	chrisp__1	the biggest ballbreaker with the debootstrap stuff is that those ops require root privs.
2014-11-13 16:20:20 - #openxt	chrisp__1	could make it a separate script to build it, and default the src_uri to some known local file location 
2014-11-13 16:23:06 - #openxt	rickl	I'd considered having the location set in .config, passed through to a variable in local.conf which is referenced in the recipe
2014-11-13 16:23:46 - #openxt	rickl	then either finding some way to prevent oe from checksumming it, or having another couple of variables passed through containing the checksums
2014-11-13 16:25:10 - #openxt	rickl	re root privs - true, though you also need root privs when you use the debootstrap images in the build (which is also bad)
2014-11-13 16:28:27 - #openxt	rphilipson	maybe we could just use some free storage service for now?
2014-11-13 16:44:16 - #openxt	chrisp__1	so why even do the debootstrap bits in OE?
2014-11-13 16:44:45 - #openxt	chrisp__1	seems like smashing a square peg in a round hole
2014-11-13 16:45:43 - #openxt	chrisp__1	currently you rely on build slaves for windows & centos. i'd probably just extend that to debian tools as well
2014-11-13 16:49:01 - #openxt	rogersc	dickonr: I have a v2 pull request up that addresses your feedback.  I went with a new approach for the template stuff and I think it's a good way of doing it.  Mind taking a look when you have some free time?
2014-11-13 16:49:11 - #openxt	rogersc	https://github.com/OpenXT/bvt/pull/5
2014-11-13 16:49:36 - #openxt	dickonr	of course
2014-11-13 16:49:38 - #openxt	chrisp__1	or perhaps make it an external process using pbuilder/sbuild, which should allow easily adding more targets
2014-11-13 16:51:32 - #openxt	rickl	chrisp__1 - I agree - I always thought it would have been simpler to use a debian build slave for this
2014-11-13 16:55:33 - #openxt	chrisp__1	i'll throw together an RFC for it
2014-11-13 16:58:34 - #openxt	chrisp__1	hey rogersc: interested?
2014-11-13 17:13:02 - #openxt	rphilipson	chrisp__1: if you go that route, that just leaves the kernel tarball
2014-11-13 17:20:40 - #openxt	chrisp__1	yeah, the tarball... i managed to get that using that url http://bit.ly/1u798BA
2014-11-13 17:21:31 - #openxt	chrisp__1	straight from the ubuntu git dealio
2014-11-13 17:23:28 - #openxt	chrisp__1	I could also just update the SRC_URI to point straight to their git tree to make it less magical
2014-11-13 17:24:48 - #openxt	rphilipson	is the repo clone a monster? i think that is why we went with the tarball
2014-11-13 17:25:27 - #openxt	rphilipson	anyway we can make set an option to do  a shallow clone?
2014-11-13 17:35:11 - #openxt	chrisp__1	i don't think you can do that with OE's git fetcher. but why worry about it? who sits around for the fetches? :P
2014-11-13 17:35:35 - #openxt	chrisp__1	ACTION goes runs time git clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/linux.git
2014-11-13 17:37:13 - #openxt	rickl	you might also check how much data it downloads :)
2014-11-13 17:37:34 - #openxt	chrisp__1	yeah i'm waiting for that stat too
2014-11-13 17:41:13 - #openxt	chrisp__1	my internet isn't  metered though ;)
2014-11-13 17:46:40 - #openxt	chrisp__1	looks like 893MB, not so bad
2014-11-13 18:12:51 - #openxt	chrisp__1	900MB sound totally unreasonable?
2014-11-13 18:17:12 - #openxt	rphilipson	sounds like a lot of data over my sad ass home network
2014-11-13 18:17:18 - #openxt	rphilipson	but whatever
2014-11-13 18:22:09 - #openxt	rphilipson	i could hack my SRC_URI to grab from my local mirror
